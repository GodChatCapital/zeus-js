## Installation

To install Zeus, use the following command:

```bash
npm install zeus-library
```

## Usage

Detailed usage information for each Zeus component is listed below:

### Blockchain
The blockchain module is used for securely storing and retrieving data. Here's a simple example:

Require Zeus

```javascript
const zeus = require('zeus-library');
const data = { key: 'value' };
const blockInfo = zeus.storeData(data);

const retrievedData = zeus.retrieveData(blockInfo);
```

Example 1: Creating a new block

```javascript
const block1 = chain.newBlock('data1');
console.log(block1);
```

Example 2: Adding a new block to the chain

```javascript
chain.addBlock(block1);
```

Example 3: Validating the chain

```javascript
const isValid = chain.validateChain();
console.log(`Is blockchain valid? ${isValid}`);
```

Example 4: Retrieving a block

```javascript
const retrievedBlock1 = chain.getBlock(block1.hash);
console.log(retrievedBlock1);
```

Example 5: Displaying all blocks

```javascript
let allBlocks = chain.getAllBlocks();
console.log(allBlocks);
```

### Nanotech

The nanotech module is used to compact data before storage and decompact data during retrieval. Usage of this module is abstracted away and is only used internally in the storeData and retrieveData functions.

Require Zeus

```javascript
const zeus = require('zeus-library');
const nano = zeus.Nanotech;
```

Example 1: Compact data into nanotech format

```javascript
let nanotechData = nano.compactData('Hello World');
console.log(nanotechData);
```

Example 2: Decomact nanotech data back into original form

```javascript
let originalData = nano.decompactData(nanotechData);
console.log(originalData);
```

Example 3: Save nanotech data to disk

```javascript
nano.saveData('file-path', nanotechData);
```

Example 4: Load nanotech data from disk

```javascript
let loadedData = nano.loadData('file-path');
console.log(loadedData);
```

Example 5: Compare original data with loaded data

```javascript
console.log(`Are original and loaded data same? ${originalData === loadedData}`);
```

### LLM
The LLM module offers advanced natural language processing capabilities, used to process user queries:

Require Zeus

```javascript
const zeus = require('zeus-library');
const llm = zeus.LLM;
```

Example 1: Process simple query

```javascript
let result = llm.processQuery('find sales data from January');
console.log(result);
```

Example 2: Analyze text for sentiment

```javascript
let sentiment = llm.analyzeText('This project is absolutely fantastic!');
console.log(sentiment);
```

Example 3: Predict next word

```javascript
let nextWord = llm.predictNextWord('The weather is');
console.log(nextWord);
```

Example 4: Answer a question

```javascript
let answer = llm.answerQuestion('Who is the President of USA?');
console.log(answer);
```

Example 5: Generate a business report from data

```javascript
let report = llm.generateReport('business data');
console.log(report);
```

### AI
The AI module learns from user data access patterns and optimizes data storage:

Require Zeus

```javascript
const zeus = require('zeus-library');
const ai = zeus.AI;
```

Example 1: Train on new dataset

```javascript
ai.train('dataset file path');
```

Example 2: Predict outcome for new data point

```javascript
let outcome = ai.predict('new data point');
console.log(outcome);
```

Example 3: Optimize data storage based on access logs

```javascript
ai.optimizeDataUsage('access logs');
```

Example 4: Learn from user interactions

```javascript
ai.learn('user interaction logs');
```

Example 5: Make recommendation based on user behavior

```javascript
let recommendation = ai.recommend('user profile');
console.log(recommendation);
```


### Quantum
The quantum module is used for complex data processing tasks:

Require Zeus

```javascript
const zeus = require('zeus-library');
const quantum = zeus.Quantum;
```

Example 1: Create a new quantum circuit

```javascript
const circuit = quantum.newCircuit(2);
```

Example 2: Add a gate

```javascript
quantum.addGate(circuit, 'H', 0);
```

Example 3: Execute a circuit

```javascript
let executionResult = quantum.executeCircuit(circuit);
console.log(executionResult);
```

Example 4: Measure a qubit

```javascript
let measureResult = quantum.measureQubit(circuit, 0);
console.log(measureResult);
```

Example 5: Execute quantum data processing task

```javascript
let taskResult = zeus.processAdvancedData('complex data');
console.log(taskResult);
```
